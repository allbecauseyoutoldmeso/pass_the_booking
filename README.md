The format will be:
a) A chat about their completed test (15 mins)

c) Joint interview with Alex and Richard. (30 mins)
(+ 30 mins leeway room left over)

You will hear on Monday whether you’ve made it to the next stage (richard will email you directly)

Last update of the day (PTK). Pls write this down:

- The conversation with Alex and I will be a character interview, which is a pretty standard format we do for all potential joiners - motivation, attitude, ambition, etc.

- Address is Techhub, 20 Ropemaker Street, EC2Y 9AR. Call Richard if any issues (07545 886523)
