Last update of the day (PTK). Pls write this down:

- The conversation with Alex and I will be a character interview, which is a pretty standard format we do for all potential joiners - motivation, attitude, ambition, etc.

- Address is Techhub, 20 Ropemaker Street, EC2Y 9AR. Call Richard if any issues (07545 886523)
